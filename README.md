# Martin R. Smith

I am an Associate Professor in Durham University's Department of Earth Sciences.  I use the fossil record to 
illuminate the origins of life's complexity.  To this end, I have developed and implemented a number of 
methods to improve the inference of phylogenetic history ("evolutionary family trees"), mainly in R/C++.

See https://smithlabdurham.github.io/ for more about my group's research interests.

# Repo highlights
